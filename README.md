# Fun!

# What is fun?

A functional utility belt, for Javascript. It's rather lovely, you should try it you'll like it.

# Why fun?

There are plenty of very good libraries to aid with functional programming in Javascript. This project sits at the seams of those projects, and rather than compete with them fun complements them.

# Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @zambezi/fun
```

# Usage

For usage, have a look at documentation for the individual functions, linked to from the [SUMMARY](SUMMARY.md).
